# Distracted Driver Detection Using Deep Neural Networks

## Problem statement: 
Given the dataset consisting of driver images in car and corresponding labels for 10 nos. categories (e.g. safe driving, texting, talking etc.), your task is to build a classification model to predict the category for that image.

## Technology Stack Used:

### Library 
1. **TorchVision** <br>
2. **Numpy** <br>
3. **Pandas** <br>
4. **MatplotLib**<br>
5. **Seaborn**<br>
### Frameworks 

1. **PyTorch**

### Other Tools/ Mechanisms

1. **Resnet-50** <br>
2. **Transfer Learning**

## Working:

1. We have analyzed the Dataset to check for distribution of data, skewness etc
2. Used torchvision library for all the preprocessing of the image data.
3. Used Transfer learning from Resnet-50 deep neural network to get a accuracy of 99% on the test data.
